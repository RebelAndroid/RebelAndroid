# My Projects

## [Phoible-Search](https://github.com/RebelAndroid/phoible-search)
A tool for searching Phoible, an online repository of phonological inventories (the sounds a language uses and how they are organized).
This is a cli tool that can count and list languages satisfying arbitrary boolean functions of sounds. For example, you can search for languages with [k] and [g], or for languages with [b], but not [p], or even languages containing [k] and [g] or containing [b] but not [p]!

## [Mapart-Go](https://github.com/RebelAndroid/mapart-go)
A tool for generating minecraft maparts, uses dithering to improve quality when working in the limited minecraft map color palette.

A colorful implementation of [boids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boids).
Written in Javascript using the \<canvas\> API for rendering.
